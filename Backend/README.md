# Backend

This is the backend for the FitFastAI project. Please refer to the project's [README](../README.md) for more information.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the server

```bash
python api.py
```

or from the root directory:

```bash
python Backend/api.py
```

*Additionally, the Flask server can be run with `flask run` from the root directory, but this is untested.*

Please refer to the root [README](../README.md) for more information on how to run the frontend.
